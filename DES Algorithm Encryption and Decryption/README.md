This project was done during my third year at AUB for EECE 455 - Cryptography and Network Security.

We were required to build a User Interface using any programming language for one of the topics listed. We chose the DES algorithm for encryption and decryption, and we used Java
Swing to build our GUI.

First, download the folder and open any Java IDE, preferably Eclipse. Import the project and run Desalg.java
Once running, you will be prompted to input a 16-bit hexadecimal message as well as a 16-bit hexadecimal key. You'll have the choice between encryption and decryption.
Once you're done, you will have your output with all the detailed steps of the DES algorithm.
